Bug List:
    1. Lag when a bomb is hit and no pygame event
        Theory: The lag comes from the delay to release mouse down, so fix that
    2. Buttons stay hover colour after clicking it when switching game states
        Need to find a way to reset it upon switching states


Feature Addition:
    1. Keep screen size constant and center the grids
        a. This is proving to require a restructure in many classes
            I may not do this because it's a small change and it's not really bad. 
    2. find a way to remove game_state from tile class


Cleaning:
    1. Have the screens inherit more similarities and edit them in their inits
    2. Remove set_position functions and add into the init of the instance


Bigger Feature Ideas:
    1. Scoreboard
        b. UI to show the top scores
    2. Build a bot (using ML) to play the game and get good. 
    3. Coop option (can play over LAN or through browser)
