Feature Addition:
    1. Keep screen size constant and center the grids

    2. make functions inclusive instead of exclusive


Bigger Feature Ideas:
    1. Scoreboard with name input (would require a file to store data (xlsx or txt would work))
        b. UI to show the top scores
    2. Build a bot (using ML) to play the game and get good. 
    3. Coop option (can play over LAN or through browser)
