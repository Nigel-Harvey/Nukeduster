# Auther:   Nigel Harvey
# Purpose:  Be the runnable file that will create a window in which the user can play minesweeper 
#           using their mouse with the GUI to click and navigate through the game

import pygame


# open game window


# let user input name and select difficulty


# set new window based on difficulty chosen


# load in game data and set clock to 0


# wait for first click, then start the clock


# loop through game logic until "Game Over" through either winning or losing


# show screen with option to continue, which doesn't impede sight of the game


# once continue is chosen, show scoreboard and leave buttons to exit or play again
