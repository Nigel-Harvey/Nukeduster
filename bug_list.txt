Bug List:
1. Sometimes the same tile is incrementing revealed_safe twice, which ends games early. This has been observed in all modes. Only while playing fast thus far

Debugging thing to remove:
    Green nukes
    print statements


Feature Addition:

2. Add timer   (txt label)
    Stop timer on game overreset timer on reset

3. Add nuke count (txt label)
    based on flags

4. rename function to be more clear -> left_click = is_revealable

Add a read_me.txt to tell the user what they need to play
    a. python 3.11
    b. py game
    c. run the nukeduster_game.py file


Big Feature Ideas:
1. Scoreboard with name input (would require a file to store data (xlsx or txt would work))

2. Build a bot (using ML) to play the game and get good. 

3. Coop option (can play over LAN or through browser)
